# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
To begin the project I started out creating my index.html first. The first thing I wanted to complete was the Navbar, which came fairly easy due to the ease of use on the Bootstrap website. From there, I added my Avatar and body text. I wanted to have this cantered in the page so I fooled around with the styling until I liked its positioning. After that was complete I added the responsive contact cards and the Linked-In link. Styling the cards was a process to get them aligned however great practice. Finally, I ended with my footer.

Contact Page - I was able to find a nice Contact me card on Bootstrap. While this contact card had a few extra inputs that were not needed, I was able to delete those and scale this form to how I wanted it to look on the webpage. 

Portfolio - I had some early dificulties scaling the responsive images to my size. I wanted to use a couple of my own photos (Kobe,Chester) however the sizing was off. I fooled around for hours trying to get a grid that worked, lined up and deciphering how to resize the image (which ended up being so simple). This was by far the most challenging part however it was great practice and I learned a ton.
